# LottieCrashApp
A demo app to reproduce a crash

## How to reproduce the crash
- clone
- `git submodule update --init --recursive` // fetch lottie dependency via submodule
- build and run for simulator

It always happens for me using xcode 13.1 on Macbook Pro with M1 Pro, saw very rare occurrences on intel simulators and never on physical devices.
